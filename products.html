Chuncheon-style dakgalbi originates from the story in which people marinated chicken instead of pork and grilled it with charcoal like pork ribs in the 1960s. Later, various vegetables, such as cabbage and onion, were added to the dish and stir-fried together on an iron plate. As people can eat it plenty at a reasonable price, dakgalbi has been popular among college students and soldiers, and at this time, dakgalbi earned its nicknames such as “People’s galbi (ribs)”, and “College students’ galbi.” The Dakgalbi Alley was established as dakgalbi restaurants were opened one by one on the backstreet of Myeongdong in Chuncheon, in the 1970s to 1980s.</p></div>

After the new city project, the stores relocated to the new downtown, leaving the area empty. In 2015, the street was rejuvenated with Makgeolli Street and Youth Mall. The street is full of restaurants and stores that was renovated providing an analog-feel combined with a trendy style.</p></div>
